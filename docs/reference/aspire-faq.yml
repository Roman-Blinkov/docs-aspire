      - question: |
          What's the difference between .NET Aspire and Microsoft Orleans?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Orleans and .NET Aspire are complementary technologies. Orleans is a distributed actor-based
          framework. .NET Aspire is a cloud-ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed
          applications. It includes local orchestration capabilities to simplify the developer inner loop and
          reusable opinionated components for integrating with commonly used application dependencies. An Orleans-based
          solution will still have external dependencies such as data stores and caches for which .NET Aspire can be
          used for orchestration purposes. We are planning to produce a sample for .NET Aspire that uses
          Microsoft Orleans (see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/issues/20)).
      - question: |
          What's the difference between .NET Aspire and Dapr?
        answer: |
          Dapr and .NET Aspire are complementary technologies. Where Dapr abstracts some of the underlying cloud
          platform, .NET Aspire provides opinionated configuration around the underlying cloud technolgies without
          abstracting them. A .NET-based application that uses Dapr can use .NET Aspire to orchestrate the local
          developer inner loop and streamline deployment. .NET Aspire includes extensions which support the launching
          for Dapr side-car processes during the inner loop.
      - question: |
          What's the difference between .NET Aspire and Project Tye?
        answer: |
          Project Tye was an experiment which explored the launching and orchestration of micro-services and support
          deployment into orchestrators such as Kubernetes. .NET Aspire is a superset of Tye which includes the
          orchestration and deployment capabilities along with opinionated components for integrating common
          cloud-native dependencies. .NET Aspire can be considered the the evolution of the Project Tye experiment.
      - question: |
          What's the relationship between .NET Aspire and the Azure SDK for .NET?
        answer: |
          .NET Aspire provides components that rely on the [Azure SDK for .NET](/dotnet/azure/intro), to expose common functionality for storage ([Azure Blog Storage](../storage/azure-storage-blobs-component.md), [Azure Storage Queues](../storage/azure-storage-queues-component.md), and [Azure Table Storage](../storage/azure-storage-tables-component.md)), databases ([Azure Cosmos DB](../database/azure-cosmos-db-component.md) and [Azure Cosmos DB with Entity Framework Core](../database/azure-cosmos-db-entity-framework-component.md)), [messaging](../messaging/azure-service-bus-component.md), and [security](../security/azure-security-key-vault-component.md).
      - question: |
          Are worker services supported in .NET Aspire?
        answer: |
          Due to a deployment related bug the preview 1 of .NET Aspire does not support deployment of worker
          servers. As a work around consider deploying a web application as a worker which is not exposed
          to the internet. We are currently tracking this issue and plan to have it resolved for preview 2 (see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/743)).
      - question: |
          Are Azure Functions supported in .NET Aspire?
        answer: |
          We have no specific support for Azure Functions in preview 1 of .NET Aspire however it is a target
          execution environment for depoyment that we are planning to support in future previews.
